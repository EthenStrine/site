There are striking similarities to the Romantic style in this beautiful poem - one of Yeat's most popular. Note the poet's use of both *figurative language* and *sensory imagery* to capture teh beauty of a pastoral scene. The emotional responses which these images inspire in the speaker also recall the Romantic tradition.  

## The Lake Isle of Innisfree  

<pre>
I WILL arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,	 
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;	 
Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee,	 
      And live alone in the bee-loud glade.	 
  
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,	         5
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;	 
There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,	 
      And evening full of the linnet's wings.	 
  
I will arise and go now, for always night and day	 
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;	  10
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements gray,	 
      I hear it in the deep heart's core.
</pre>
