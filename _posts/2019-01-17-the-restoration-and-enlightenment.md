&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "Restoration" refers to the restoration of the Monarchy, which occured in 1660 with the return of the Stuart royal family and the coronation of Charles II, son of the murdered King Charles I. Following Oliver Cromwell's death in 1658, the British middle classes, tired of strict Puritan rule - reestablished commmunication with Charles II, exiled in France, paving the way for a bloddless return to parliamentary government and the Monarchy.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the primary focus of the British government was to maintain stability, the death of Charles II in 1685 brought his brother, James II, a devout Catholic, to the throne - "**The Glorious Revolution**" the removal of James from the throne once again, *without bloodshed*.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James' daughter **Mary** ruled jointly with her husband **William of Orange** from 1689-1702 - her sister, **Queen Anne** (1702-1714) died childless. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than have the throne pass to **James Stuart**, rightful heir, but another Catholic, the Stuart succession was ended in favour of the **German Elector of Hanover - George I** (1714-1727) assumed the throne in 1714.

The first two Hanoverian kings (**George I, George II**) were a lot more interested in affairs back in Germany than in England and allowed power to fall almost completely into the hands of Parliment, *where it remains today.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **George III** attempted to be a tough guy and rule England more actively, but he only succeeded in losing the American Colonies!

These events, including the defeat of the military attempt to reestablish the Stuarts on the throne, illustrate how much *more powerful* Parliment had now become in the era.  

This is because of the Magna Carta. {: .notice}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two-party system began to emerge in the Parliment

### The Whig Party
>Represented primarily those with financial and mercantile intrests, the cities and towns, and opposed the influence of the Monarchy.

### The Tories
>Represented the country squires - the gentry - all those who favoured the old traditions (many had supported the Stuarts' attempted return)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two major disasters for England during the Restoration Period were the **Plague of 1665** and the **Great London Fire** which occured in 1666.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new "rational age" brought an increased understanding of the importance of ***science*** with the emergance of men like *Sir Isaac Newton, William Harvey,* and *John Lock*.


English class society could, by this time, be divided up as follows:  

    1. The Great, who live profusely  
    2. The Rich, who live very plentifully  
    3. The Middle Sort, who live well  
    4. The Working Trades, who labour hard, but feel no want  
    5. The Country People, Farmers, etc., who fare indifferently  
    6. The Poor, that fare hard.  
    7. The Miserable, that realluy pinch and suffer want

Marriage during this era was still, largely, an economic arrangement, joining families and estates - two of the most popular ***novels*** of the era, *The History of Tom Jones* by Henry Fielding and *Clarissa* by Samuel Richardson illustrated the unhappy situations that frequently result from these arrangements.

<center> Religious life still continued to be dominated by the <i>Anglican Church</i>, the state religion.</center>

For the increasingly influential **middle class**, the new social center became **coffeehouses**, where different political and professional groups would gather to discuss the affairs of the day - the most popular ones of the era in London were   **Loyd's** / financiers, merchants, ship owners (the most famous insurance firm in the world - *Lloyd's of London* was established here)   
**Will's** / writer's mostly   
**White's** / politicians, lawyers, free-and-easy aristocrats  
other popular coffeehouses included **St. Jame's, The Grecian, Buttons,** and **The Turk's Head** - all of these gathering places became the centers for serious discussion of things like religion, philosophy, literature, domestic and foreign affairs, and plenty of pleasent or malicious gossip!
