This famous poem is of a type called by some the *"meditative poem"*, used frequently by Romantics - it begins with an observation of the **outside world**, moves quickly to an **internal meaning**, and ends back in the outer world again.  


II 2-4 - **imagery** - sound here here in II 3-4 provides connection between the landscape and the quiet sky in lines 7 & 8.  
II 9-13 - **imagery** the description of the valley relies on **visual** images - the dominant impression is of greenness, quietness, and peace.  
I 24 - expressed in convoluted fashion; for a blind man, the landscape is unseen and, therefore, unimportant - *not so for the speaker*!  
II 25-28 - whether he is lonely or in a crowd, the speaker derives pleasure from his memory of the scene  
I 49 - an extra ordinary claim for nature's powers, of a kind normally reserved for rekgion!  
I 50 - 50 Romantic appeals to perosonal experience of validity - "it is true because I have felt it!"
