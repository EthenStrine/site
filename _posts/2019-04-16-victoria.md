The Victorian age began with the ascension to the British throne of 18 year old Queen Victoria in 1837, succeeding her uncle, William IV - the last of the Hanoverian monarchs, Victoria reigned for 68 years until her death in 1901.

The word "Victorian" is, in our contemporary society, often commonly associated with prudishness and sexual repression, but this is something of an over simplification. Although extremely conservative, the Victorians had a very progressive attitude with regard to social reform - the Victorians were forced to deal with both the positive and the negative aspects of the industrial revolution, particularly its effects on religious faith.
