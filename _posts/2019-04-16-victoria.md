## Background 
The Victorian age began with the ascension to the British throne of 18 year old Queen Victoria in 1837, succeeding her uncle, William IV - the last of the Hanoverian monarchs, Victoria reigned for 68 years until her death in 1901.

The word "Victorian" is, in our contemporary society, often commonly associated with prudishness and sexual repression, but this is something of an over simplification. Although extremely conservative, the Victorians had a very progressive attitude with regard to social reform - the Victorians were forced to deal with both the positive and the negative aspects of the industrial revolution, particularly its effects on religious faith. 

The Victorian Age is usually discussed in terms of three basic periods - **The Early**, **The Middle**, and **The Late Periods**. 

## The Early Period (1832 - 1848)  

Passage of the **First Reform Bill** (1832) extended the vote to the middle class. (specifically, property owners paying at least 10 pounds of rent annually) - also, there occurred the redistribution of parlamentary representaion.  

Mass poverty still remained, despite these changes - the working classes and the lower middle classes still have no voting rights - also the "**Corn Laws**" kept the price of things and other related foods ridiculously high - the repeal of this and other similar laws helped to increase prosperity and improved living conditions for the poor - it also ushered in **free trade**.  

## The Middle Period (1848 - 1870)

England achieved its greatest world and economic power during this time period - London became a world center for banking and shipping - English towns like Sheffield and Birmingham became the centers for the wool and metal industries.
