# "A Song for St. Cecilia's Day"
## - John Dryden

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poem helps us to usher in the *Neoclassical Period* in English literature - *neoclassicism* is the revival in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries of classical standards of **order, balance,** and **harmony** in literature. Neoclassical writers like Dryden and **Alexander Pope** developed a style that was characterised by good form, logic, symmetry, grace, good taste, restraint, clarity, and conciseness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poem is an ***ode*** - a poem, originally intended to be sung, whose stately, orante language is appropriate to its serious subject - it is a loft poem on a diginified theme.
