William Blake's work heralds the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century Neoclassical Period - for Blake, the essential universe is not physical and rational, but spiritual and irrational - it must be unuderstood through *imagination* and through *intuition*.

## "Introduction"
*Symbolically*, the child on the cloud probably represents **both** the infant Jesus and "every child."

II 3-4 - **persona** - the speaker is the poet  
I 9 - the child weeps out of joy for the devine elegance of the song.  
I 13 - various prophets and writers have claimed to have recieved a simliar command  
II 16-19 - **parralelism** - these lines convey Blake's deliberate execution of the angel's command (the child is an angel!)
