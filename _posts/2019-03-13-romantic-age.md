With regard to English Literature, the **romantic** period is generally accepted to have begun with the pubication of *Lyrical Ballads* by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge in **1798**, however, romanticism actually had stronger roots in Europe and developed somewhat earlier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word "romantic" was first used in **Germany** in 1798 by the critics Friedrich and Augest Von Schlegal - the word "**romance**" originally referred to medieval tales of knightly adventures written in the French derivative of the orginal **Roman** (or romance) language, ***Latin***.

These tales often involved the amorous encounters between an knight and his lady - thus, the modern meanings of the words "romance" and "romantic."

For our purposes of study, remember that **romance**, from the literary perspective, refers to the "freely imaginative idealizing fiction" and ***not*** love between a man and a woman.

**Romanticism** can be best defined through comparison to the **neoclassical** age which preceded it - the age of Dryden, Pope, Swift, and Johnson.
