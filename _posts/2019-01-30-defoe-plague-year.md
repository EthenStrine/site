### Background

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1664 and 1665, more than 70,000 died of plague in London alone (pre-plague population was more than 500,000). The effects of the plague were horrifying. The initial symptom was swellings, which appeared in the groin or armpits, some as large as an apple. These eventually spread in all directions over the body. Black or red spots then broke out and, eventually, the lymphatic system became infected. Glands became swollen and inflamed, further swellings caused bleeding underneath the skin as death approached. Delirium was the result of the disease’s effect on the central nervous system.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defoe’s journalistic style shows in the *narrator’s* focus on the externals of the event rather than on the thoughts of the people. Defoe was only about 4 years old when the plague was raging, so his account is based on the recollections of those who were there and survived, official records, etc. His **point-of-view** is significant in the telling of this story – the entire passage is an excellent study in the use of ***verisimilitude***

### Paragraph I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Setting* is important in the opening paragraph - Defoe makes use of **personification** to describe the "face" of London and its surrounding areas - he achieves an emotional response in the reader by focusing on the plague's effects on families and those that feel they "should be summoned in the next hour...."  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Paragraph II, III, & IV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, in describing the great pit where the dead were placed, Defoe illustrates a more journalistic style by describing the pit's specific dimensions and the various problems associated with its use. Also, discussing the numbers of dead thrown into the pit helps Defoe capture the sheer horror of the plague's devastation.
