The 'Byronic Hero' - one of the most prominent literary character types of the Romantic period - traits most closely associated with this character are as follows:  
- the Byronic Hero does **not** possess heroic virtue, but has many **dark** qualities.
- s/he is a "larger than life" character.
- s/he is usually isolated from society - a wanderer or is in exile of some kind.
- s/he is **moody** by nature or **passionate** about a particular issue - their emotional and intellectual capacties are superior to the average
- as a result, the Byronic hero is often arrogant, confident, abnormally sensitive, and extremely conscious of himself.
- s/he rejects the values and moral codes of society - because of this, he is often unrepentant by society's standards.
- often characterised by a guilty memory of some unnamed sexual crime.
- due to these characteristics, the Byronic hero is often a figure of repulsion as well as facination.


### "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage" (Apostrophe to the Ocean)
This is the poem that made Byron the most famous poet in England. It consists of four cantos that were written over a period of six years. It is, primarily, a **travelogue** - the first two cantos, published in 1812, are based on Byron's travels through Spain, Portugal, Albania, and Greece from 1809 to 1811. The poem follows the wanderings of Childe Harold ("childe" is a medieval term for a young nobleman awaiting knighthood), a melancholy, passionate, guilt-haunted, but proud outcast who, as a fictional projection of one aspect of Byron's own personality, establishes the prototype for the "Byronic hero." Canto III is considered to be the poem's finest section, but Canto IV contains many fine moments, including our excerpt, Byron's famous address to the ocean.
