The 'Byronic Hero' - one of the most prominent literary character types of the Romantic period - traits most closely associated with this character are as follows:  
- the Byronic Hero does **not** possess heroic virtue, but has many **dark** qualities.
- s/he is a "larger than life" character.
- s/he is usually isolated from society - a wanderer or is in exile of some kind.
- s/he is **moody** by nature or **passionate** about a particular issue - their emotional and intellectual capacties are superior to the average
- as a result, the Byronic hero is often arrogant, confident, abnormally sensitive, and extremely conscious of himself.
- s/he rejects the values and moral codes of society - because of this, he is often unrepentant by society's standards.
- often characterised by a guilty memory of some unnamed sexual crime.
- due to these characteristics, the Byronic hero is often a figure of repulsion as well as facination.
