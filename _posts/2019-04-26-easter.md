On Easter Sunday of 1916, Irish nationalists launched a spirited but unsuccessful revolt against the British government, which had ruled Ireland with an iron fist for three centuries.  
The week of street fighting that followed is known as the Easter Rebellion. The leaders of the rebellion were captured and executed. After the First World War, fighting broke out again, and in 1922 Britain recognized Ireland's Dominion status.

    I have met them at close of day
    Coming with vivid faces
    From counter or desk among grey
    Eighteenth-century houses.
    I have passed with a nod of the head
    Or polite meaningless words,
    Or have lingered awhile and said
    Polite meaningless words,
    And thought before I had done
    Of a mocking tale or a gibe
    To please a companion
    Around the fire at the club,
    Being certain that they and I
    But lived where motley is worn:
    All changed, changed utterly:
    A terrible beauty is born.

In the first stanza, Yeats is describing Dublin (which was pretty easy for him as he lived in one). He then goes on to speak about how he remembers talking to the rebels on the street or in the club. He mentions his belitting of the rebels to his friends, `And thought before I had done of a mocking tale or a gibe to please a companion.` Towards the end of the stanza, Yeats intoduces to us a simple, subtle, yet powerful metaphor of *motley*. **Motley meaning a mash-up of different colors**, it's also used to describe people at times.  
The people of Dublin could be said to be a *motley* group in 1916: they were Catholic and Protestant, Irish in spirit but English in terms of citizenship, poor and rich. The River Liffey divides Dublin; many of the rebels worked on the poorer north side of the city. The stanza ends with the line `a terrible beauty is born.` This line is going to end every stanza.

    That woman's days were spent
    In ignorant good-will,
    Her nights in argument
    Until her voice grew shrill.
    What voice more sweet than hers
    When, young and beautiful,
    She rode to harriers?
    This man had kept a school
    And rode our wing√®d horse;
    This other his helper and friend
    Was coming into his force;
    He might have won fame in the end,
    So sensitive his nature seemed,
    So daring and sweet his thought.
    This other man I had dreamed
    A drunken, vainglorious lout.
    He had done most bitter wrong
    To some who are near my heart,
    Yet I number him in the song;
    He, too, has resigned his part
    In the casual comedy;
    He, too, has been changed in his turn,
    Transformed utterly:
    A terrible beauty is born.

In the second stanza, Yeats begins to
