On Easter Sunday of 1916, Irish nationalists launched a spirited but unsuccessful revolt against the British government, which had ruled Ireland with an iron fist for three centuries.  
The week of street fighting that followed is known as the Easter Rebellion. The leaders of the rebellion were captured and executed. After the First World War, fighting broke out again, and in 1922 Britain recognized Ireland's Dominion status.

    I have met them at close of day
    Coming with vivid faces
    From counter or desk among grey
    Eighteenth-century houses.
    I have passed with a nod of the head
    Or polite meaningless words,
    Or have lingered awhile and said
    Polite meaningless words,
    And thought before I had done
    Of a mocking tale or a gibe
    To please a companion
    Around the fire at the club,
    Being certain that they and I
    But lived where motley is worn:
    All changed, changed utterly:
    A terrible beauty is born.

In the first stanza, Yeats is describing Dublin (which was pretty easy for him as he lived in one). He then goes on to speak about how he remembers talking to the rebels on the street or in the club. He mentions his belitting of the rebels to his friends, `And thought before I had done of a mocking tale or a gibe to please a companion.`
