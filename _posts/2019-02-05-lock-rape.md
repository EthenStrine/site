excerpt: "The Rape of the Lock is a mock-heroic narrative poem written by Alexander Pope.[1] One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque, it was first published anonymously in Lintot's Miscellaneous Poems and Translations (May 1712) in two cantos; a revised edition "Written by Mr. Pope" followed in March 1714 as a five-canto version  accompanied by six engravings."
